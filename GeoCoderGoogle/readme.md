## 🌎 Google JS GeoCoder

> This code uses the famous API google Geocoder. Use this in your JavaScript website. 
> It will give you any information about an address. 

### Introduction
I've built this JS function for a client. 🐉 
They wanted to get pieces of information about an address such as the country, postal code, street number, and town after a request.

### How it works

- In index.js, change the data of **const address** for the address you want to request.

- Run the main.html file and look at the data in your Console.

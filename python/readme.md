# Python projects

Here you will find some of my Python work. I've mixed algorithms and Internet of things.

Look at my **smartGreenHouse** project. It's one of my favorites!

### AlarmSystem

IoT project using GPiO and Raspberry Pi. The main goal was to build an app for my electronic setup. 
When the door opens, you need to enter a code to stop it. 
The app also gives you the wheater.

### Calculator

Simple python calculator using pygame.

### DigitalFrame

This program is designed to run with a digital frame built with a Rasberry Pi. 
Choose your pictures, and the app will reframe them to fit in your frame! It will run all the album and start again until the end of time. :feelsgood:

### LibrarySystem

CLI program to simulate the rent of books in a library.

### MazeGenerator

Are you a maze lover? You will love this one! With my python file, I can generate a new maze of the size you want when you run it!

## SmartGreenHouse

This program is my favorite. It's a massive personal project. I build an electronic greenHouse with Arduino, Raspberry Pi, a water pump, and a humidity and temperature captor. You can follow the input in real-time in a JavaScript app and water it! Perfect for your vacation!

## TicTacToe

Do you want to play tic tac toe? Do it with our robot! We code it with Experta library. I don't think that you can beat our new master! :robot:

## VoiceReconition

When you say 'blueberry', the computer will start listening to what you're asking. You can ask for time and temperature and control some elements in your house connected with a raspberry Pi.

## WordOccurence

This program can list all the words in a text and tell you how many times each word appears.

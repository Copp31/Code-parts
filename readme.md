# :cd: Welcome to my projects section!

> I code in Python, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. I've been working with C++ but only with my Arduino projects.

# JavaScript

I use JavaScript to build a website, app, and animation projects. My favorite framework is react.js. 
My favorite JS projects are my Portfolio (react.js) and appContact (mongoose). Check those two! 

# Python

I code in Python for Internet of things and algorithms projects. I've also been using this language for rooting websites, but I genuinely prefer JS. 
My favorite project is the SmartGreenHouse (Arduino, Raspberry Pi, JS), the MazeGenerator(Algorithm), and the TicTacToe (Experta).

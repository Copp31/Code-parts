# :nesting_dolls:  Welcome to my projects section

> I code mainly in Python, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. I've worked with C++ for Arduino and electronic projects. <br/>
> <br/>
> In this Repository, I've organized my work by the primary language, but if you want to see my favorite, read this readme! 

# JavaScript

I use JavaScript to build websites, applications, and animations. I can work with the library React.js.
<br/>
My favorite JS projects are my **Portfolio (react.js) and appContact (mongoose)**. Check those two! 

# Python

I code in Python for Internet of things and algorithms projects. I've also used this language for rooting websites, but I prefer JS. 
<br/>
My favorite project is the **SmartGreenHouse (Arduino, Raspberry Pi, JS), the MazeGenerator(Algorithm), and the TicTacToe (Experta)**.

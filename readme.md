# :nesting_dolls:  Welcome to my projects section

> I code mainly in Python, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. I've worked with C++ for Arduino and electronic projects. <br/>
> <br/>
> In this Repository, I've organized my work by the primary language, but if you want to see my favorite, read this readme! 

# [JavaScript](https://github.com/Copp31/Coding/tree/main/JavaScript)

I use JavaScript to build websites, applications, and animations. I can work with the library React.js.
<br/>
My favorite JS projects are my [Portfolio](https://github.com/Copp31/Portfolio) and [AppContacts](https://github.com/Copp31/Coding/tree/main/JavaScript/appContacts). Check those two! 

# [Python](https://github.com/Copp31/Coding/tree/main/python)

I code in Python for Internet of things and algorithms projects. I've also used this language for rooting websites, but I prefer JS. 
<br/>
My favorite project is the [SmartGreenHouse](https://github.com/Copp31/Coding/tree/main/python/smartGreenHouse), [MazeGenerator](https://github.com/Copp31/Coding/tree/main/python/mazeGenerator), and the [TicTacToe](https://github.com/Copp31/Coding/tree/main/python/ticTacToe).

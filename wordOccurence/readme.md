## :computer: Word occurence algorithm

> This program will give you the number of times each word appear in a text. 

### Introduction
I've build this python algorithm for an art gallery in Montreal. :art: 
They wanted to know the amount of times each word were wrotten in their gallery text for the last decade.

### How it works

- Drag the text you want to analyze in this folder and name it yourtxt.txt.

- Go in this folder and run in your commande line : 
```
py wordOccurence.py

```

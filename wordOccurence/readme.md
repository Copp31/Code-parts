## :snake: Word occurrence algorithm

> This program will give you the number of times each word appears in a text. I code this in Python.

### Introduction
I've built this Python algorithm for an art gallery in Montreal. :art: 
They wanted to know the number of times each word was written in their gallery text for the last decade.

### How it works

- Drag the text you want to analyze in this folder and name it **text.txt**.

- Go in this folder and run in your command line : 
```
py wordOccurence.py
```
